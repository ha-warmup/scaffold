## Introduction

This is the blank **integration scaffold files** created using the Home Assistant developer scripts:

* install development environment - https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/en/development_environment.html
* create the scaffold - https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/en/creating_component_index.html

### Updates required

In Jan 2020 core devs have made [changes to the scaffold](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/compare/scaffold-update), so we might be wise to refresh this before using it
